### Overview

This repo contains an incomplete linked list implementation, with failing tests.

You can run the tests with the following command:

```
ruby test/list_test.rb
```

A good solution will:
  - fill in the existing public methods
  - add private/protected methods as necessary, following good design principles
  - make all existing test pass
  - add additional tests if necessary
