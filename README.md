### Overview

This repo contains an incomplete linked list implementation, with failing tests.

You can run the tests with the following command:

```
ruby test/list_test.rb
```

A good solution will complete the implementation by:
  - filling in the existing public methods
  - adding private/protected methods as necessary, following good design principles
  - making all existing test pass
  - adding additional tests if necessary
